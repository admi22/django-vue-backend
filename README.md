# Django Backend with Sessions

This is the backend skeleton for a production django backend. 
It has endpoints for CSRF and Sessions supporting communication with a SPA frontend. A simplistic Vue frontend communicating with this backend can be found at https://github.com/admi22/django-vue-frontend.

This source code is closely based on this tutorial: https://testdriven.io/blog/django-spa-auth/#frontend-served-separately-cross-domain
